## Histrory of Java
Java was conceived by James Gosling, Patric Naughton, Chris Warth and Mike Sheidan at Sun Microsystem in 1991.
It was initially called Oak but was later renamed Java in 1995
The primary motivation was the need for a platform-independent language
that could be used to create software to be embedded in various consumer electronic devices,
such as toasters, microwave ovens, and remote controls.
At the time of Java's creation one of the most exciting features was the appelet.
* An Applet * is a special kind of Java program that is designed to be transmitted over the internent and automatically executed inside a java-compatible web browser. They excute3 locally rather than on the server
Passive information
Dynamic Active programs

Applet support was removed by JDK 11

* Serverlet * is a program that executes in the server

# Java Buzzwords
Simple - java has concise, cohencive set of features that makes it easy to learn and use
Secure - Java provides a secure means of creating internent applications
Portable - java programs can execute in any enviroment for which there is a java runtime system
Object-Oriented - Java embodies the mordern object-oriented programming philosophy
Robust - java encourages error free programming by being strictly typed and performing run-time checks
Multithreded - Java provides intergrated support for multithreaded programming
Architecture-neutral - java is not tied to a specific machine or operating system architecture
Interpreted - java supports cross-platform code through the use of java bytecode
High-performance - The java bytecode is highly optimized for speed of execution
Distributed - Java was designed with the distributed enviroment of the internent in mind.
Dynamic - java programs carry with them substantial amounts of run-time type information that is used to verify and resolve access to objects at run time

# object-oriented Programming
it's a powerful way to approach a job of programming 
They are organized around data,
with the key principle being “data controlling access to code.” In an object-oriented language,
you define the data and the routines that are permitted to act on that data. Thus, a data type
defines precisely what sort of operations can be applied to that data
To support this java has three traits in common Encapsulation, Polymorphism and Inheritance

* Encapsulation *
Is a programming mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates, and that keeps both safe from outside interface and misuse
Java's basic unit of encapsulation is the class
Class define the form of an object an object is an instance of a class, the code and data that constitute a class are called members of the class

* Polymorphism *
Greek word (many forms) is the quality that allows one interface to access a general calss of actions, the specific action is determined by the exact nature of the situation

* Inheritance *
is the process by which one object can aquire the properties of another object. 

# The Java Deverloper Kit
In general,
you should first find the JDK you want to use. For example, at the time of this writing, the
Oracle JDK can be downloaded from www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/. Also
at the time of this writing, an open source version is available at jdk.java.net. Next, download
the JDK of your choice and follow its instructions to install it on your computer. After you have
installed the JDK, you will be able to compile and run programs.

JDK supplies to primary programs javac and java

High qualities IDE available for java such as NetBeans and Eclipse
